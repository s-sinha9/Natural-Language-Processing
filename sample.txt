A: Good evening, sir, and welcome to Chez Attitude.

B: We have a dinner reservation for four at 7:00 under the name of Foster.

A: Yes, Mr. Foster, if you would please be seated over in the waiting area, our hostess will be with you in a moment.

B: Thank you. Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting?

A: Of course, I will tell her.

B: I would really prefer an outside table. Would that be possible?

A: Sure, if you would like one of those tables, I could seat you right away.

B: Sure, that would be great! Thank you!
